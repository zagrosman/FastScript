# FastScript
This page will provide highly fast-running python scripts for biologists and biotechnologists. I want to develop my ideas to help my colleagues all over the world for saving their time during computational analyses. In addition to my scripts, I'll also try to simplify current scripts for computational calculations. The source of scripts and the example files for each section will be added to related folders. Academic users can easily get these scripts either through the Ubuntu command line or direct downloading of source files in each page. 

# How users can cite the prepared scripts here?
To answer this question I should say that the users can check each folder for finding relevant tools or papers for citation. If the users have a problem with the collected files in this repository, my email (# h3n.rasouli[@]gmail.com) is freely available. 


# Which types of scripts will be indexed?
I specifically use this repository to share python scripts or batch files. For other types of scripts written in R or Perl languages, the users can check other folders in my GitHub homepage for finding other scripts. 

# How many updates will be available for each repository?
Since preparing and developing scripts need spending much time to manage their scaffold, mainly all repositories will be updated after two or three months after sharing. For some queries including R and python scripts, the updates are monthly available. If the schedule changes over time, I'll try to notify the respected followers and academic users.
