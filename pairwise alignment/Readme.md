# Compare two protein sequences

To conduct a pairwise alignment on two protein sequences, you can use this script. The script uses the pairwise2 module from Biopython to perform a global pairwise sequence alignment of the two protein sequences. The BLOSUM62 substitution matrix is used to score matches and mismatches, and the gap open and extension penalties are set to -10 and -0.5, respectively. The script then prints the alignment results to the console.
