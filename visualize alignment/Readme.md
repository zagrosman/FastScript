# How to run visualizealn.py?

To run this code, you need to save it as a Python script with a `.py` file extension (e.g. `alignment_plot.py`). Then, you need to ensure that the `alignment.fasta` file is located in the same directory as the script.

You can run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the script is saved using the `cd` command, and then typing python `alignment_plot.py` (assuming you have `Python 3` installed on your system and the `matplotlib` and `biopython` libraries are installed as well).

After running the script, a file named `alignment.png` will be created in the same directory, containing the high-resolution PNG image of the multiple sequence alignment.
