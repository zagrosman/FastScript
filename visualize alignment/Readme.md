# How to run visualizealn.py?

To run this code, you need to save it as a Python script with a `.py` file extension (e.g. `alignment_plot.py`). Then, you need to ensure that the `alignment.fasta` file is located in the same directory as the script.

You can run the script by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the script is saved using the `cd` command, and then typing python `alignment_plot.py` (assuming you have `Python 3` installed on your system and the `matplotlib` and `biopython` libraries are installed as well).

After running the script, a file named `alignment.png` will be created in the same directory, containing the high-resolution PNG image of the multiple sequence alignment.

# How to run alignment_plot.pl?

1. First, make sure BioPerl and GD are installed on your system. 
2. Adjust the `$font_size` and `$dpi variables` to control the font size and image resolution, respectively.
3. To run the script, you need to save it as a `.pl` file (e.g. alignment_plot.pl) and run it from the command line using the command `perl alignment_plot.pl`.
4. Check the generated .png file to amend its graphical features.
